      <p class="highlight"> CONFIDENTIAL: THIS SITE IS IN AN UNFINISHED STATE (AS YOU CAN TELL BY MOST OF THE LINKS NOT WORKING), PLEASE COME BACK LATER.  THIS SITE IS A MOCKUP CURRENTLY SOLELY FOR INTERNAL DEMOS AND NOT FOR OUTSIDERS</p>
          
      <p> Retrospectively is a non-profit passion project. Retrospectively does not assume any liability for content recorded/captured using this platform. By using retrospectively you agree to our term and condition.  Our term is "Don't use ANY of our software to do ANYTHING illegal in your place of residence" and our condition is "WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANYTHING YOU RECORD/CAPTURE WITH OUR SOFTWARE". 
      </p>    

      <p> Lastly, about data, any user data recorded/captured during the <a href="./demo">web demo</a> are deleted from our servers after they have been processed.  We can't really prove this without going open source, and we probably aren't gonna do this anytime soon so just take my word for it.  If you have any questions about GDPR compliance, well that doesn't matter because we don't cater to Europeans (yet, hopefully soon!)

        You can contact me by sending an email to <a href="./">dev@retrospectively.xyz</a>, but I'll probably respond faster on WhatsApp.
