                    <p>This is the unpublished WebDemo dashboard, it's 'mostly' functional but the server (with the ML models) has not been deployed yet.  Come back later to try us out!  But if you're a developer (which you should be) give me your feedback on the look and feel of the page!</p>

                    <p>Ideally, point the camera at whoever you're talking to and start the model (click start)!  Our model will analyze their facial expressions as well as what's being said (and the tone) to give you live feedback on your conversation.</p>

                    <p>However, most of you are probably using this on a computer with a fixed webcam which this isn't meant for - we'd like to have the final version embedded in a pair of glasses that have a camera.  This web version is mostly to to just show the functionality of the model, which you can test by calling a friend over, pointing your webcam at them, and talking to them.  We apologize for the fact that this demo isn't the most easily used tool (as of now) but we still think it'd blow your mind if you gave it a try!</p>

                    <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

                    <p>Enable camera and microphone permissions for this site and reload.  If that doesn't work email me at <a href='mailto:dev@retrospectively.com'>dev@retrospectively.com</a> with a description of your setup (browser, computer, etc) and an output of your console log.</p>
