        <p>Hello, welcome to the web version of Retrospectively, this demo is currently in an unpublished internal ONLY state and may be prone to errors, bugs, and glitches in general.  If you find any please email me at <a href='mailto:dev@retrospectively.com'>dev@retrospectively.com</a>.</p>

        <p>On the left you'll see the camera feed, ideally this is capturing the expression of your conversation partner (i.e. whoever you're talking to).  Then once you start recording we'll use this and the audio feed from your microphone to analyze your conversations. Lastly, throughout the conversation our speech coach will give you live feedback - this will be spoken aloud to you, I recommend airpods (don't worry it'll be short, non-intrusive, and only when needed).</p>
          
        <p>On the right you'll see a text box with the live feedback you'd get during a conversation.  Before that is a dropdown list of conversation logs, these are specific points of interest from your conversation as identified by our Speech Coach.  You can click on them to expand them, and they'll also be annotated with feedback.</p>

        <p>By continuing you agree to allow us to collect your data for the purposes of running the model (i.e. your conversation data) - don't worry we delete it after we process it.  Oh and you also agree to our <a href='./about'>terms and conditions here</a>.</p>

                    <h2>How to Use</h2>

                    <p>This is the unpublished WebDemo dashboard, it's 'mostly' functional but the server (with the ML models) has not been deployed yet.  Come back later to try us out!  But if you're a developer (which you should be) give me your feedback on the look and feel of the page!</p>

                    <p>Ideally, point the camera at whoever you're talking to and start the model (click start)!  Our model will analyze their facial expressions as well as what's being said (and the tone) to give you live feedback on your conversation.</p>

                    <p>However, most of you are probably using this on a computer with a fixed webcam which this isn't meant for - we'd like to have the final version embedded in a pair of glasses that have a camera.  This web version is mostly to to just show the functionality of the model, which you can test by calling a friend over, pointing your webcam at them, and talking to them.  We apologize for the fact that this demo isn't the most easily used tool (as of now) but we still think it'd blow your mind if you gave it a try!</p>

                    <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

                    <p>Enable camera and microphone permissions for this site and reload.  If that doesn't work email me at <a href='mailto:dev@retrospectively.com'>dev@retrospectively.com</a> with a description of your setup (browser, computer, etc) and an output of your console log.</p>
